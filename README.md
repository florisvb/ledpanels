This is a ros catkin package to facilitate controlling the reiser led panels through ROS / python.

The original code was written by Steve Safarik, and ported to a catkin package by Floris van Breugel.

See arena_experiments for a simple usage example for closed loop stripe fixation. Some / all of the rospy.sleep commands may not be necessary.
